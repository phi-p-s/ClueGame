# ClueGame

This was basically a semester long Java project for my CSCI 306 class: Software Engineering.  While not a very meaningful or impactful piece of software,
the purpose of creating this game was to teach us the Agile and Scrum workflow.

Each step and functionality that was built to make this game had several unit-tests along with it.
